        Protecting your privacy is important to us. At all times, we aim to respect

        process this data fairly and lawfully in accordance with the Data Protection
        Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) which came into
        force at the end of May 2018.
        <br />
        <br />
        This Privacy Notice (Notice) explains what information we collect from you,
        how we use that information and our legal basis for doing so. It also covers
        whether and how that information may be shared and your rights and choices
        regarding the information you provide to us. By choosing to share your
        personal data with us and using the services offered by Frazzled Cafe, you are
        acknowledging that you have understood and agreed to the terms of this Notice.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you have any questions about this Notice, please contact us via the
        “Contact us” section on our website (

        <span class="font-semibold">When and how we collect your data</span>
        <br />
        In order to fulfil our charitable objectives, and provide the best experience
        that we can when you interact with us we may collect information from you in
        various ways including:
        <br />
        <br />
        When you interact with us directly:
        <br />
        <br />
        This could be if you sign up to our mailing list, register to attend a
        Frazzled Cafe meeting, make a donation to us, apply for a job or volunteering
        opportunity or otherwise provide us with your personal information.
        <br />
        <br />
        When you interact with us via online platforms that we use to fulfil our
        charitable objectives; including our website and a small number of trusted and
        secure third-party services that we use for managing event bookings and
        capturing data via online forms and surveys:
        <br />
        <br />
        We gather general information which might include which pages on our website
        you visit most often, and which pages you visit when you click on links in
        emails from us. Some platforms may also collect technical information such as
        the internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the
        internet and time zone setting. There are more details below – see ‘Cookies &
        usage tracking’.
        <br />
        <br />
        When you interact with us via third parties:
        <br />
        <br />
        This could be if you provide a donation through a third party such as KindLink
        or interact with us through social media and provide your consent for your
        personal information to be shared with us.
        <br />
        <br />
        When it is available publicly: 
        <br />
        <br />
        Your personal information may be available to us from external publicly
        available sources. For example, listed directorships, information from the
        electoral roll and press reports – we may obtain this personal information,
        for example, when undertaking due diligence on potential donors or fundraising
        partners to ensure they align with our mission and values.
        <br />
        <br />
        We may combine your personal information from one or more of these sources for
        the purposes set out in this Notice.
        <br />
        We endeavour to ensure that the information we hold is accurate and, where
        necessary, kept up to date. If you wish to access, update or request deletion
        of your personal information we will ensure that such requests are always
        acted on in a timely and appropriate way.
        <br />
        <br />

        You have a range of rights over your data, which include but are not limited
        to the following:
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Where data processing is based on consent, you may revoke this consent at

          </li>
          <li>
            You have the right to ask for rectification and/or deletion of your

        <br />
        We take your privacy very seriously and we are committed to ensuring that your
        information is secure. To prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, we have
        put in place suitable procedures to safeguard and secure the information we
        collect.  This includes protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing
        and against accidental loss, destruction or damage. The transmission of
        information via the internet (including e-mail) is never completely secure
        however, and although we do our best to protect it, we cannot guarantee the
        security of personal information transmitted via the internet.

        <span class="font-semibold">Donor due diligence</span>
        <br />
        Like many charities, we need to undertake checks on individuals who give or
        propose to give large donations to us, so that we are complying with our
        duties to protect charity funds, assets, and reputation, and to comply with
        the “know your donor” principles further to Charity Commission guidance, to
        prevent fraud. We may use third party suppliers to assist us with these
        checks, and we may obtain information from publicly available sources in order
        to do so. Donor due diligence may also include information which is considered
        “sensitive personal data”. This may include personal information regarding
        racial or ethnic origins, political opinions, religious beliefs, health and
        also information concerning criminal offences.
        <br />
        <br />
        <span class="font-semibold">
          Do we collect/share sensitive personal information?
        </span>
        <br />
        Data privacy law identifies certain categories of personal information as
        sensitive and therefore requiring more protection, for example information
        about your health or ethnicity. In limited cases, we may collect and/or use
        your sensitive personal information (also known as special category data).
        Normally we will only do so where we have your explicit consent, but there may
        be other circumstances permitted under data privacy law. For example, we may
        record that a person is in a vulnerable circumstance in order to comply with
        requirements under charity law and fundraising regulation to ensure that we do
        not send fundraising communications to them.
